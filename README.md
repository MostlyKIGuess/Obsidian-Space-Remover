# Obsidian Space Remover
- It finds and replaces the files in your vault which have spaces.

## Why did I make this?
- Number one, when I took a backup of my vault, I realise I had a lot of files with space, altho it does look beautiful but at the same time I didn't realise that it is consider invalid file outside obsidian. So I lost it during the zip unzip process, which was quite sad.
- Secondly, using Latex export we can't use this spacing because it is not considered valid markdown, so inorder to export my obsidian notes as Latex pdf , I need this plugin.
- Thirdly, it's fun. hehhehe
